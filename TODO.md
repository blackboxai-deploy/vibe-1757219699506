# Real-Time Face Anonymization System - Implementation TODO

## Core Application Structure
- [x] Create TODO.md file
- [ ] Create root layout with privacy-focused design
- [ ] Create main dashboard interface
- [ ] Create video processing core component
- [ ] Create control panel component
- [ ] Create settings modal component
- [ ] Create stream viewer component

## Backend API Development
- [ ] Create face detection API endpoint
- [ ] Create video processing API endpoint
- [ ] Create face detection utilities
- [ ] Create video processing utilities

## React Hooks & State Management
- [ ] Create media stream management hook
- [ ] Create face detection hook

## Dependencies & Setup
- [ ] Install TensorFlow.js dependencies
- [ ] Install video recording dependencies
- [ ] Install additional media processing libraries

## Integration & Testing
- [ ] Install all dependencies using pnpm
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [ ] Build application with pnpm run build --no-lint
- [ ] Start production server with pnpm start
- [ ] Test face detection API with curl commands
- [ ] Test video processing API with curl commands
- [ ] Validate real-time video processing functionality
- [ ] Test webcam integration and privacy controls

## Final Validation
- [ ] Comprehensive API testing for all endpoints
- [ ] Verify real-time performance and accuracy
- [ ] Validate privacy and security features
- [ ] Generate final preview URL for demonstration

## Current Status
Starting implementation of core application structure...
